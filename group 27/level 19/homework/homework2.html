            <h1>Brand identity</h1>
            <p>The world of bullfighting is a key part of Lamborghini's identity.[35][36][37] In 1962, Ferruccio Lamborghini visited the Seville ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, 
            a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting bulls. Lamborghini was so impressed by the 
            majestic Miura animals that he decided to adopt a raging bull as the emblem for the automaker he would open shortly.</p>

                <h2>Vehicle nomenclature</h2>
                <p>After producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini once again turned to the bull breeder for inspiration. 
                Don Eduardo was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a car for his family and their line of bulls; the fourth Miura to be produced was unveiled to him at his ranch in Seville.[38][39]
                The automaker would continue to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. Espada is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes used to refer to the bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double meaning; though it was intended to refer only to the historic bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic</p>

                <p>Throughout its history, Lamborghini has envisioned and presented a variety of concept cars, beginning in 1963 with the first Lamborghini prototype, 
                the 350GTV. Other famous models include Bertone's 1967 Marzal, 1974 Bravo, and 1980 Athon, Chrysler's 1987 Portofino, the Italdesign-styled Cala from 1995, the Zagato-built Raptor from 1996.
                A retro-styled Lamborghini Miura concept car, the first creation of chief designer Walter de'Silva, was presented in 2006. President and CEO Stephan Winkelmann denied that the concept would be put into production, saying that the Miura concept was "a celebration of our history, but Lamborghini is about the future.
